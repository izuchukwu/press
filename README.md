# Press üíå

Press is an experimental literate code tool. Press processes literate code files like Literate JS or Literate Ruby into regular source.

Press uses Markdown and an added `.md` extension to source files so they're readable in GitHub & GitLab, and uses `.gitattributes` settings so your project's language breakdown stays the same. Press works for any language.

## Using Press

*Press is a work in progress, so this is to come.*

Install Press:

```bash
yarn add --dev press-literate

# or with npm
npm install --save-dev press-literate
```

Set up & use Press:

```bash
npx press init
npx press source/hello.js.md lib/
```

`press init` sets your repo to recognize `.js.md` files as JS using your `.gitattributes` file. You only need to run it once per project. After, you can use Press with the options below to process your literate code.

## Press options

Use Press with the `press` command in your scripts, or using `npx press`.

## Pressfile

Out of the box, Press supports any language that uses `//` for line comments, like JS, TypeScript, or C++. Use Pressfile to add support for other languages to Press. For example, to add Press support for Ruby, we'd make a Pressfile `.press` at the root of our project like so:

```json
[
	{
		"language": "ruby",
		"extensions": ["rb"],
		"comment": "#"
	}
]
```

When Press comes across a `.rb.md` file, it'll convert it to a `.rb` file, convert code blocks to regular source, and prefix every line of prose with `#` and a space. It'll also set your repo to recognize `.rb.md` files as `ruby`. The `language` name should match a name or alias in [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).

Pressfiles also supports using block comments, like so:

```json
[
	{
		"language": "c",
		"extensions": ["c"],
		"blockCommentStart": "/*",
		"blockCommentEnd": "*/"
	}
]
```

After modifying your Pressfile, you'll need to run `press init` again.

## Writing literate code

To read best on GitHub & GitLab, using [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is recommended. Press converts any fenced or indented Markdown code blocks to code, and (by default) comments out prose to preserve line numbers. For proper syntax highlighting, it's recommended to use fenced code blocks with a language set, like so:

~~~markdown
# Hello

Prints a nice little greeting.

```js
console.log("hello!")
```
~~~

Then give your code an added `.md` extension, like `hello.js.md` for example, which becomes `hello.js` with its prose commented out after running it through Press.

## Literate code?

A lot is lost when we write code‚Äîour reasoning, our constraints, our mental process. Literate code lets our code express both what we're trying to do, as well as how it was done and why. Opinionated? Maybe. I'm big on software being both user- & developer-friendly.

Press uses Markdown for literate code as it's readable on the web, easy to pick up, and so it can stay hands-off in how you decide to define literate for you.
